-Prior to starting this KATA I knew I would be splitting the array and could either iterate through the array and reverse or utilize the methods of .split() .reverse() and .join(). So I used the latter. I then realized through my research and remembering in lecture that I could chain these methods and would get the same outcome of the reversed array.
